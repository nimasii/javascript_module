# Overview

This program uses JavaScript to play a small mini golf game in a web browser. The game starts at an instructional screen that will update to the game area when the screen is clicked.

A shot is taken when the spacebar is pressed. You can control the power of the shot by pressing space bar when the shot meter is higher or lower, but direction is completely random and generated by random numbers. You total shots are counted and displayed when the ball makes contact with the finish line at the end of the hole

I wrote this program in Visual Studio Code using javascript, html, and css.

The only included library is JQuery which is hosted through a CDN
